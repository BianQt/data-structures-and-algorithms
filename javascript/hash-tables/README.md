## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps. In other words, write a function that accept two hash maps as arguments  and  return a data structure that holds the results of Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.

* Input ==> Two Hashmaps
* Output ==> Array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I used arrays to store keys , values &  the results of Combine the key and corresponding values

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- ```leftJoin``` : return an array that holds the results of Combine the key and corresponding values
